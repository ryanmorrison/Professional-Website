It was a pleasure giving an invited talk at the [3rd Annual UNM Resilience Colloquium](http://res-ins.unm.edu). The colloquium was filled with interesting discussions of managing human and natural systems for resilience. I was able to meet up with my PhD advisor, Mark Stone, and eat too many green chiles! Thank you, Dr. Stone and Dr. Taha, for the invitation.

P.S. My department colleague, [Hussam Mahmoud](http://www.engr.colostate.edu/~hmahmoud/_), gave an awesome keynote talk.
